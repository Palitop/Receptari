00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.270
When I come home in principle, that's
different, this it is different.

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.880
Now it may seem over some crazy.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.610
They ask for a next NextRadio originally
that you get to this point.

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:25.530
Are you trying to put out unnecessary
elementals was killed in a separate

5
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:35.460
ALBERGOTTI. You're the ones called to power
on the minimum, you know, almost a quarter

6
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.290
parameter when I have no control pun.

7
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.790
A simple intent is how much work to do on
those that escape from the U.S.

8
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.290
detained in this.

9
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.450
I mean, can you think of anyone?

10
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110
Adina's our son.

11
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.480
Getting the industry, I guess I'm able to
tell is how.

12
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.250
I guess that's the way it's going to feel.

13
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.650
You know why you don't want to smoke it is
how much of this moment I say it.

14
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.050
Yeah, I mean, I almost I had a link, but I
get well soon.

15
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.620
Potato Dulmatin to follow you.

16
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.490
Garbanzos Lehman bastardizes Humble Diner.

17
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.670
You don't forget to deliver your opinion that
you were up on it when I went out and think

18
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.250
how they react. If you see what I was going
on, I think it's really important to

19
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.490
be able to we up on almost allowed EU.

20
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.820
Ocado is what it looks like.

21
00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.240

Alamos Garbanzos.

23
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.700
It's not punishment for the Raptors.

24
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.850
Eat them up on it.

25
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.140
Labetalol Darina unpopular element.

26
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.990
If it's also you seem so.

27
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.150
I mean I think they almost caught between
Pablo Elaman unanimous agreement.

28
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.050
I love this kind of movie, but a little boy
who was here when I said they don't like the

29
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.580
celebrity bubble, wrap it up in case they
don't go to the theater.

30
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.150
See, the bomb will move it from Gaza.

31
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.880
Then it must remember that Iraqis have one
element in a bubble and then getting on a

32
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.170
little in between, I don't know, praise
Perkasie.

33
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.070
No, no, we're not a weapon that was taking
place.

34
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.350
So it will have a school or getting our air
force here know us.

35
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.740
Yeah, but mostly it's a poor nothing it
excludes, including the real political

36
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.980
headache. It's just a local party mass.

37
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.180
Who was out there.

38
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.270
Lapita I tell that mozzarella elements.

39
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.730
Elizardo, I get animals to the Super Bowl
cardio perimeter.

42
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.480
They started, you know, Obama's idea of
policy and this law went on through.

43
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.000
But they're concerned about the use of that
money.

44
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.480
But I want to so I said in a moment of the
momentum, Obama said about, as he says, he

45
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.020
and there is a game boy, I said in a polio
did me go

Disney Gado is one for yoga boys.

53
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.920
Boys, how can all these mammals you can call
it that here.

54
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:11.100
Burrito delivery took an extra yukky and
there was a fire secretary call for you and

55
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.730
you got all your stuff he knows, but more
support will be more the U.S.

56
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.410
will get from overseas on a typical American
economy than Latin America with the result

57
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:35.780
that here, no matter what I think what
Barack Obama said with the solar panel,

58
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:44.950
but we'll stock up on it at Fresco's
Eurogamer, Motorola, DamiÃ¡n, as he gave me

Mirabilis, FLC, Yemeni's, Lakotas, brothers.

Simple Mosaica in Austria E is important.
